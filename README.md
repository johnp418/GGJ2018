## Setup

## To play
1. Memorize the directions based on number of tiles. One key press (arrow keys) equals one tile.
2. Once the timer disappears (and the maze is covered), generate a sequence of directions by pressing arrow keys. The sequence will appear on the left pane named "Your Move"
3. You may reset the sequence as you would like.
4. When you are ready to see the sequence in action, press 'Transmit' button.
5. Set your robot free.
